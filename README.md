This is my first plugin

Basically you can now set specific items and how much damage they will do. 
Very useful if you wanna make those loka practice servers and dont wanna bother setting up different protection armours to get that correct 33% damage boost.



This plugin is 100% made on java after learning it for a month, its my first plugin and I've not even touched kotlin yet so please dont hate me.
There is also a /toggleboost command that can be used by OPs to toggle the plugin on or off, there is also a config file as well :D
