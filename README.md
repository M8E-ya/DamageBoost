# DamageBoostPlugin
This is my first plugin, its pretty simple.
Basically you can now set how much damage you want your specififc items to do in minecraf. 
very usefull if you wanna make those loka practice servers and dont wanna bother setting up different quality armour to get that correct 33% damage
